    <h2>The Text</h2>
    <p class="main-paragraph">What to write about... Excel!</p>
    <div>
    <p>In the land where cells happen to take a whole lot more time, 
        <span>In the hills and valleys,
         where much of every single thing is considered,
        </span>
        <p>This is a very nice paragraph</p>
        At a glimpse when it comes to things ranging from atomicity and deciding what fills up your workbook at the end of the day.
        In the grid of endless cells,
        A canvas stretches, vast and wide,
        Numbers dance, and formulas dwell,
        Beneath the sheets where data hides.
        Each tab a world, untold, unseen,
        Where columns hum in ordered rhyme,
        And rows like rivers, crisp and clean,
        Flow with the rhythm, ticking time.
        The workbook whispers silent dreams,
        Of charts that soar and pivots turn,
        A structured beauty, more than it seems,
        Where patterns rise, and insights burn.</p>
